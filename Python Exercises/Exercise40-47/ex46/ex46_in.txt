JSON, short for JavaScript Object Notation, is an open standard. Although its name doesn’t imply so, it is a language-independent data format. With Python’s JSON library, we can read, write, and parse JSON to both store and exchange data using this versatile data format. It’s a prevalent data format because it is easy to read and write for humans as well, although not as easy as YAML!

In this article, I’ll show you how to use the built-in Python JSON library. In addition, we’ll take a look at JSON5: an extension to JSON that allows things like comments inside your JSON documents.
